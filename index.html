<h2>Winter is coming.</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Find enough acorns to last for the impending winter!</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
It was supposed to be a fun sort of scavenger hunt game, reminiscent of a childhood romp through the woods. It would be easy to get lost in this game, ideally.</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
Top-down maze game.
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
Ostensibly, the player would be able to move the squirrel up, down, left, or right across the game world (except through the trees) using the cursor keys. 
    
The player has to collect a certain amount of acorns and make it to the exit with the acorns before the time limit runs out.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
Primarily, it was evaluating the use of tilemaps and .json files. I'll be the first to admit it didn't work well for me. </li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
It would have been a fairly original melding of time limits and maze running. </li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
You're in a strange land where autumn doesn't exist, and the seasons change directly from summer to winter. Fairies are real in this world, though they don't show up in this prototype.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
The squirrel has procrastinated too long, and thus runs the risk of starving if he doesn't madly rush through the forest in search of acorns!
    

</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
I'm trying to reach the kids who still like bounding through the forest, though if they're playing my game, they wouldn't be bounding through the forest. Hmm.
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
The time limit would've been around 5 minutes, which seems adequate. </li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Go south first; there are many acorns in a clearing that way. It'll be difficult to find the path there, though! 
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
I made all the visual elements from scratch using JPixel, but the music files are from incompetech.com, by Kevin MacLeod.
    
The sole sound effect is from soundbible.
    
The .json parsing code is from an online tutorial posted on Blackboard. Didn't quite work for me though. 
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Any sort of maze running game would be most similar to my game.
